[sadako Yamamura]
([https://www.example.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Yamamura)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Yamamura)

*Sadako Yamamura, reimagined as Park Eun-suh and Samara Morgan for their respective adaptations, is the main antagonist of Koji Suzuki's Ring novel series and the film franchise of the same name.*
*How did Sadako survive for 30 years?
Knowing his plans, Sadako flees outside to an old well. Ikuma chases her and grabs a nearby machete, bludgeoning her head twice, before dumping her body inside the well. Sadako used the power of hate to sustain herself for 30 years but eventually dies.*

*Kurahashi recounts Sadako's origin story: She was born with the ability to strike people dead with a thought, and, fearful of her power, her father threw her down a well to kill her, inadvertently creating a curse that killed many people.*

*Sadako kept folding cranes even though she was in great pain. Even during these times of great pain, she was known by hospital staff and other patients as cheerful and helpful, and always asking for scraps of paper or material to continue folding cranes. Although Sadako knew she would not survive, she folded well over 1,000 cranes and continued to be strong for the sake of her family. In October 1955, with her family standing by her bed, she died.*
